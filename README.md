# All-In-One Fitness: Web-Based Scheduling & Registration System

## Overview
The **All-In-One Fitness Web-Based Scheduling & Registration System** is a full-stack web application designed to streamline class scheduling and member registration for a fitness studio with **500+ members**.  
This system replaces manual tracking with a secure, database-driven solution to improve operational efficiency and data accuracy.

## Problem
Many fitness studios rely on spreadsheets or manual processes to manage class schedules, registrations, and reporting. These approaches are inefficient, error-prone, and difficult to scale.

This project addresses these challenges by centralizing data management and automating key workflows through a relational database and web interface.
